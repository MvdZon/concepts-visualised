title: "Russia is not a great power"
summary: "Many people overrate the Russian GDP and thus its power. Probably because the Soviet Union was one of the great powers in the past. To make clear how small it actually is, its true economic power has been visualised."
subtitle: "GDP(Gross Domestic Product) is a number that describes the complete domestic output of a nation, and thus it's economic power. 
This is an incredibly important statistic to determine how powerful a nation is. Although there are some drawbacks(insert tooltip) to using this metric"
